Answer: To determine how many apples you have left after buying more and giving some away, follow these steps:

1. **Initial Apples**: You start with 15 apples.

2. **Apples from Bags**: You buy 3 bags, each containing 8 apples, which adds up to \(3 \times 8 = 24\) apples.

3. **Total Apples**: Add the apples from the bags to your initial amount: \(15 + 24 = 39\) apples.

4. **Giving Away Half**: You give away half of the total apples: \(\frac{39}{2} = 19.5\) apples.

5. **Apples Left**: Subtract the given away apples from the total: \(39 - 19.5 = 19.5\) apples.

Therefore, you have 19.5 apples left. If dealing with whole apples, consider how you manage the half apple, typically rounding down, leaving you with 19 whole apples.
