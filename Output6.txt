Answer: Let's solve this problem step by step:

### Step 1: Identify the initial number of apples.
- You start with 15 apples.

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of apples after buying more.
- You buy 3 bags, each containing 8 apples.
- To find the total number of apples from the bags, multiply the number of bags by the number of apples per bag: \( 3 \times 8 \).

Let's calculate that using a tool.

Answer: Let's think through this step by step:

### Step 1: Identify What We Need to Find
1. **Define Python Programming Language.**
2. **Determine Today's Date.**
3. **Calculate if Python Was Created More Than 30 Years Ago From Today.**

### Step 2: Gather Necessary Information
1. **Define Python Programming Language:**
   - I'll search for information about Python's definition and creation date.
   
2. **Determine Today's Date:**
   - I'll use a tool to get the current date.

### Step 3: Perform Searches and Calculations
Let's execute the searches and get the current date in parallel.

1. **Search for Python Programming Language Information.**
2. **Get Today's Date.**

I'll perform these operations now.

Answer: Let's solve this problem step by step:

### Step 1: Identify the Prices and Discount
We have three items with the following prices:
- Laptop: $800
- Mouse: $25
- Headphones: $75

The discount on each item is 20%.

### Step 2: Calculate the Discounted Prices
To find the discounted price of each item, we need to calculate 20% off each original price.

The formula to calculate the discounted price is:
\[ \text{Discounted Price} = \text{Original Price} \times (1 - \frac{\text{Discount Percentage}}{100}) \]

I'll calculate the discounted prices using this formula.

### Step 3: Calculate the Total Discounted Price
We will sum the discounted prices of all items to find the total amount spent after the discount.

### Step 4: Calculate Change from a $1000 Bill
Subtract the total discounted price from $1000 to find out how much change you would receive.
