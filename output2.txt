EXAMPLE 1: Multi-step mathematical problem
======================================================================

======================================================================
USER QUERY: If I have 15 apples and I buy 3 more bags with 8 apples each, then give away half of my apples, how many do I have left? Please show your step-by-step reasoning and use the calculator tool.
======================================================================

ITERATION 1
======================================================================

🤖 AGENT OUTPUT:

💭 Thinking:
🤔 **THINK:**

1. You currently have 15 apples.
2. You buy 3 more bags with 8 apples each.
3. You then give away half of your apples.
4. I need to calculate step by step: 
   - Total apples after buying
   - Apples left after giving away half

📋 **PLAN:**

1. Calculate total apples after buying the additional bags.
2. Calculate total apples left after giving away half.

⚡ **ACT:**

1. Calculate the total number of apples after buying more bags:

   - Total apples from bags: \(3 \text{ bags} \times 8 \text{ apples per bag} = 24 \text{ apples}\)
   - Total apples now: \(15 \text{ original apples} + 24 \text{ apples from bags}\)

Let's calculate the total apples.

======================================================================
ITERATION 2
======================================================================

🤖 AGENT OUTPUT:

💭 Thinking:
🔍 **REFLECT:**

- After buying more bags, the total number of apples is 39.

⚡ **ACT:**

2. Calculate the number of apples left after giving away half:

   - Apples given away: \( \frac{39}{2} \)

Let's perform this calculation.

======================================================================
ITERATION 3
======================================================================

🤖 AGENT OUTPUT:

💭 Thinking:
🔍 **REFLECT:**

- Half of 39 apples is 19.5. Since you can’t have half an apple in this context, I'll assume you give away 19 apples.

- Apples left: \(39 - 19\)

Let's calculate the remaining apples.

======================================================================
ITERATION 4
======================================================================

🤖 AGENT OUTPUT:

💭 Thinking:
✅ **CONCLUDE:**

After buying more apples and giving away half, you have 20 apples left.

**Reasoning Path:**
1. Start with 15 apples.
2. Buy 3 bags with 8 apples each: \(15 + 24 = 39\) apples.
3. Give away half (rounded to nearest whole number): \(39 - 19 = 20\) apples remaining.
