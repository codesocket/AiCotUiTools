💭 Thinking:
Here's the step-by-step calculation:

1. **Initial Apples:**
   - You start with 15 apples.

2. **Buying More Apples:**
   - You buy 3 bags with 8 apples each: \(3 \times 8 = 24\) apples.

3. **Total Apples Before Giving Away:**
   - Add the newly bought apples to your initial amount: \(15 + 24 = 39\) apples.

4. **Giving Away Half:**
   - You give away half of your apples: \(39 / 2 = 19.5\).

So, you have 19.5 apples left. However, since you can't have half an apple in practical terms, this would mean you likely have 19 whole apples left.
